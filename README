# Please insert your name in the following comma separated list, and push
# changes back up to the branch in my repo. If you're successful doing that,
# then we know that everything via Git/GitHub is working correctly for you :D

# In a few weeks, we'll create and join a new organization on GitHub
# (SoCS Consulting) and put a new fork in there to develop into a release
# version.
